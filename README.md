# Deadly Dress-Up
## High Concept
It’s the Dark Souls of dress-up games, and the evil cousin of Style Savvy! Deadly Dress-Up asks players to dress up their zombie character in a way that’ll please the lords of the underworld within a limited amount of time. If they fail to do so...well, they can just try again; the Demon Lords aren’t very good at their job either.


## Genre
While it’s difficult to categorize a game as complex as Deadly Dress-up, it likely would fit into these categories:
* Casual
* Simulation
* Puzzle
* Dating Sim
* Time Management

## Platform
This game is initially a desktop only game, but there’s the possibility for mobile versions in the future.

## Story
You’re a zombie who has just risen from the dead, but you have nothing to wear! To avoid embarrassing not only yourself, but the Demon Lord who let you rise from the dead, you need to pick a fantastic outfit. The only downside is that your Demon Lord is having guests over soon, so you need to follow their instructions as to what outfit is appropriate. If you don’t dress up well enough in time, then it’s back to the un-undead for you!

The game is fast paced, comedic and just generally light hearted. Each time the player makes an appropriate outfit, they are able to progress to the next level  and have to make a new outfit to please someone else; each outfit would be increasingly complex. For the scope of this class project however, I like would not be able to make too many levels, or any that are especially difficult.
