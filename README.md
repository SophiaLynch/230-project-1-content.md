# Deadly Dress-Up
## High Concept
It’s the Dark Souls of dress-up games, and the evil cousin of Style Savvy! Deadly Dress-Up asks players to dress up their zombie character in a way that’ll please the lords of the underworld within a limited amount of time. If they fail to do so...well, they can just try again; the Demon Lords aren’t very good at their job either.


## Genre
While it’s difficult to categorize a game as complex as Deadly Dress-up, it likely would fit into these categories:
*Casual
*Simulation
*Puzzle
*Dating Sim
*Time Management
