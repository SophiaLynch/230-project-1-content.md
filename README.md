#Deadly Dress-Up
##High Concept
It’s the Dark Souls of dress-up games, and the evil cousin of Style Savvy! Deadly Dress-Up asks players to dress up their zombie character in a way that’ll please the lords of the underworld within a limited amount of time. If they fail to do so...well, they can just try again; the Demon Lords aren’t very good at their job either.
